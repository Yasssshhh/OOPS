The capability of a class to derive properties and characteristics from another class is called Inheritance. 

Inheritance is a feature or a process in which, new classes are created from the existing classes. The new 
class created is called “derived class” or “child class” and the existing class is known as the “base class” or “parent class”.

So the derived class will have all the features of base class and in addition to that it can also add features of its own.

//Derived class
Syntax: 

class  <derived_class_name> : <access-specifier> <base_class_name>
{
        //body
}
