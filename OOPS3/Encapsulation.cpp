// It is considered good practice to declare your class attributes as private (as often as you can). Encapsulation ensures better control of your data, because you (or others) can change one part of the code without affecting other parts
// Increased security of data

//  A data validating function can stop illegal values from entering the object and preserving the integrity of the data.
// With data hiding, you can write code that checks the data coming into a class to make sure it is valid before assigning it to member variables.
